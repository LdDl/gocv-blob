## About
This small package implements basics of blob tracking (see ref. https://github.com/MicrocontrollersAndMore/OpenCV_3_Car_Counting_Cpp/blob/master/Blob.cpp)

## Installation

First of all you need OpenCV to be install on your operation system. Also you need [GoCV](https://github.com/hybridgroup/gocv) package to be installed too. Please see ref. here https://github.com/hybridgroup/gocv#how-to-install

Then you are good to go with:
```go
go get github.com/LdDl/gocv-blob
```

p.s. do not be worried when you see *can't load package: package github.com/LdDl/gocv-blob: no Go files....* - this is just warning.
